## TODOs

### Responsive thumbnail in podcast card--how can those be fixed width and height?
### Pagination component doesn't always work as expected when it reaches the end of the results
### Pagination click updates offset before nextOffset
### Need better NavBar and SearchBar
### NavBar, Podcast component, and Episodes Container should all be sized relative to the viewport height (VH) together. e.g. Navbar style = 10 VH, Podcast = 30 VH, and Episodes Container = 60 VH -- how to make child compents size responsively?
### Audio knob gets squished at the end of the episode
