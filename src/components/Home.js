            Snippr is a podcasting listening web application that allows users to split podcast episodes into smaller audio clips, or "snippets", for downloading or adding to their library. To get started, click <a href="/search">search</a> in the navigation bar and search for your favorite podcast. Here's a quick mini tutorial:

            This project was inspired by my mother, Katie O'Toole, who is a professor of journalism at Penn State's College of Communications. She teaches a course in podcasting and expressed the need to send small clips of podcast episodes to her students in order to highlight the dos and don'ts of podcasting. Katie has a podcast herself, <a href="podcasts/af679e331dad496f8c3ee0b93c42a618">Dead Centre</a>, about the stories, people, and events that make up the rich history of Centre County, Pennsylvania. Check it out!

            Snippr is a frontend React application backed by a Rails API. In addition to this same-origin API, Snippr also pulls from the <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/api/">ListenNotes API</a> in order to fetch podcasts and episodes.
